# Project 0
Included in my submission is 5 files compiling all that was learned from Lecture 1
In my first file labeled " Hello.html", it displays the min/max width media queries, before components as well as links to each individual html page.
In my second file labeled "Web1.html", it displays an introduction of style sheets, grids, class selectors, ordered & unordered list, and bootstrap components.
My third file labeled "Web2.html", introduces sass compilation as well as further style sheets.
My fourth html file labeled "Web3.html", brings in the idea of input's, id's, datalist, and forms.
My final file labeled "Web4.html", incorporates more style selectors, media queries and hiding text when given the option to print.
Lastly are the attached .scss and .css files.
