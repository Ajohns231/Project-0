            Learning web development is actually fun when you type all of of this
            stuff out in a program, click save, and then it magically pops up on a
            whole new screen.

        <h3 id="section 2">Section 2</h3>
          <p>
              You basically start out copy and pasting things, then add in a couple
              links to a couple pages, add in some headers, seperate things,add some
              color in, maybe some pictures to spruce things up and bam!
          </p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h4 id="section 3">Section 3</h4>
          <p>
              The amount of lines really does start to add up over time but it's not so
              bad once you start getting used to it. Well at least not for me, I
              actually really like this kind of stuff.

      <div>
        <h5 id="section 4">Section 4</h5>
          <p>
              Isn't it interesting how the header is getting smaller and smaller?
